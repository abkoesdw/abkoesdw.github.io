I'm Arief, an Indonesian living in Canada. I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer/Data Scientist for General Motors Canada. 

Previously, I worked at Cognitech as a Machine Learning Engineer in Waterloo. My work consisted of designing a multi-keyword speech recognition algorithm and an anomaly detection model for industrial time-series data. 

Before that, I was a research assistant at the Centre of Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, University of Waterloo, where I built an ML-based driver distraction detection technology for the next generation of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).

I have a PhD in the area of AI/ML, where I investigated large scale time-series predictions under uncertainties using modern ML techniques (at that time). Specifically, I developed algorithms that predict multi-step ahead in the future a large network of non-stationary time series with streams and event-based data.
