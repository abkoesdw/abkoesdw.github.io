The USAD-2 is a project where we develop a unmanned ground vehicle for security applications. The vehicle is equipped with a 4-DOF robotic arm, a 2-DOF riffle, and 3 controlled cameras. I developed the instrumentation and control systems that are used to control the vehicle, robotic arm, cameras and the riffle remotely.
